The bible: https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/     -> here we have the documentantion, don't know -> search, read, ...

my all god book: https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtdesigner-manual.html    -> use it 

first we need to see how to make the connection.
I searched on the internet and saw that my intuitions is correct and i should use TCP/IP protocol.
Arian is going to take care of the connection, but i will try to help him with some info. After we see that the connection works we can move to the next step ... code
In the meantime i will make the interface to look nice. So i think that i will be on FrontEnd and Arian on BackEnd



For Arian:
in the documentation is Network and Connectivity
